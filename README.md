# Fire_RecognitionAI

Fire_RecognitionAI is an AI model that was developed to detect fire by ret-training the Resnet18 model using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabilan03/fire-detection-dataset) from Kaggle. A few years ago, a fire was left unattended in my apartment building. Luckily, the sprinklers turned on and nobody was hurt. However, residents of the building needed to move so water damage could be addressed. By creating this AI model, I hope to minimize not just our cities, but nature too. Tens of thousands of wildfires occur each year, potentially, my AI model could give firefighters advance warning to save our planet.

Here is an image of my model successfully identifying a fire:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21c7c2f3-b6bf-40b0-b1d9-85c32d8fa7e4)
